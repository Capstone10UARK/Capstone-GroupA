How the program starts:
1. main method in Main.java
	a. VFI_Map.Init()
		-uses the preloaded color key to create the RGB mapping
	b. Controller.startView()
		-creates the controller (allows us to draw vectors on still images)
		-creates the view	
			*View is the meat of the GUI (View is a frame)
			1. Connects model and controller to the view
			2. 3 panels are created (each will be put into the View frame)
			   **1 panel has the selected image/video
			   **1 panel has buttons to control video
			   **1 panel has buttons for the rest of the controls
			3. Action listener in view checks for buttons

***From here the basic GUI is setup
***The only panel that is different is the frame/video panel thanks to VLCJ
***This panel is of type MyPanel (extends JPanel)

Fixable problems
1. MyPanel.java is where the location of the VLC download is required
        -Change NATIVE_LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATH (member variable)

	-The contructor of MyPanel loads the library for VLCJ
	   -In Native.loadLibrary(RuntimeUtil.getLibVlcLibraryName().....)
	   -This method saves us because it will get the library in 
	   	".so", ".dll", etc. (whatever format)
	
	-There is a workaround for the path being absolute, but I don't care about
	that right now
	
2. View.java in getUserInput() method
	-I didn't bother with the user not entering something
	-It does create an error (try it)
	
	
Other Crap
1. In MyPanel.java
	a. addVideo method is where mac sucks
	  -VLCJ claims that macs do not support this way of uploading videos
	  *NOTE: java does have ability to detect OS (System class I think)
	  --could add a conditional for this, but then we'll have to find
	     how Mac sets up VLC videos in java (VLCJ says there is a way...just different from others)
	  
2. In Controller.java
	a. I have a condition that says don't add vector until frame is set
	  -This means that vectors won't draw on the video
	  -There is still methods that need to be researched to tune the video
	    so this conditon is left for now

3. In View.java
	a. Screen capture button doesn't work right now.  I am working on that
  	    right now.
  	    
  	    
***********LAST IMPORTANT THINGS***************************

We must run the code with the .jar files from VLC

1. They have to be included in compilation AND run

    *my build.bash file should be a decent reference for this
    *This is also why a makefile is a good idea cause they can be 
    	configured according to OS
    *something as simple as seperating my .jar files with : in the bash file
      is different based on OS (windows has a semicolon instead of a colon)
      
   NOTE: Running the code may complain about a log file...ignore it.

2. When running a video, you may see nothing
    *Expand the panel that the video is suppose to be in and then press play
    *Video is still a work in progress...not sure why this happens
