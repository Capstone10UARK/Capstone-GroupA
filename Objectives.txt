SVAS PROJECT GOALS

Write a Java program that associates an RGB color with an appropriate flow vector
Write a program that selects an area of a still image
Write a program that evaluates the mean vector of a selected area
Construct a Java frame to hold and graphically represent our program
Add all programs into said frame
Create results screen for Java frame
Fine-tune averaging to accurately match up to real-world measurements

Stretch:
Convert all logical functionality into language more widely used by biomedical engineers (MATLAB, Python) for the sake of further tuning and/or adding new functionality
Develop an algorithm to fill in the white spaces left by vectors by examining surrounding pixels and filling in with corresponding colors
Add functionality to the main program to take in an .avi file and allow users to scrub through frame-by-frame to select frame to inspect
